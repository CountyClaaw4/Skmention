**skmention** is a Script that adds Discord-like mentions to Minecraft chat,
making player communication clearer and reducing missed messages on busy servers.

## ✨ Features

* **Discord-like Mentions**  
  Mention players in chat using `@player` or `player!` — messages are harder to miss on busy servers.

* **Clear Visual & Sound Notifications**  
  Mentioned players receive an action bar message and a sound, ensuring important messages are noticed instantly.

* **Global Mentions with Admin Control**  
  Use `@all` / `@everyone` to notify everyone online, with permission-based access for admins only.

* **Spam-safe Cooldown System**  
  Built-in cooldowns prevent mention abuse and keep chat readable.

* **Multi-language Support (14+)**  
  Automatically adapts to the player’s language, with a fallback to a configurable default.

* **Highly Customizable**  
  Adjust mention formats, sounds, cooldowns, and behavior through simple options.

* **Player-level Moderation Tools**  
  Ban or allow mentions per player for flexible server moderation.

* **No Dependencies**  
  Works as a standalone Skript — no extra addons required.

* **Wide Version Compatibility**  
  Supports Minecraft 1.12.2 → 1.21.11 and Skript 2.4.0+.

## 🎯 Who is this for?
